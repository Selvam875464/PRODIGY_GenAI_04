# PRODIGY_GenAI_04  
Task 4 – Image-to-Image Translation using Pix2Pix | Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This task explores image-to-image translation using the Pix2Pix model, a type of Conditional GAN. The model is trained to generate realistic facade images from building outlines. The implementation uses TensorFlow and the Facades dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- TensorFlow Datasets  
- Pix2Pix (from `tensorflow_examples`)  
- Google Colab  

## 📁 Files  
- `PRODIGY_GenAI_Task04_Pix2Pix.ipynb` – Colab notebook containing the full code and output

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
- Understood Conditional GAN architecture and Pix2Pix model  
- Worked with paired datasets for image translation  
- Learned how to preprocess image data for training GANs  
- Visualized real-time output images during training
